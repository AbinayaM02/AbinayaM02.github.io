Iâ€™m currently the CTO of Nunnari Labs (Coimbatore) where I manage the technological strategy, orchestrate the development of cutting-edge AI and ML solutions while staying attuned to the ever-evolving landscape of the AI/ML domain. I have more than a decade of experience in managing distributed teams and building end-to-end AI/ML solutions and products for some of the Fortune 500 companies and one of the big four consulting firms. I also hold a part-time Program Manager role at IITM for an open source project called, Hidden Voices, that aims to close the gender gap on Wikipedia. 

I identify myself as a seasoned engineer with the right blend of data science and engineering skills with expertise is in NLP, NLG, MLOps, Gen AI and LLMOps. I love contributing to open source and have published several research papers as a result.

I also co-lead an open source community called [AI Tamil Nadu](https://aitamilnadu.org/) for the past six years and have been contributing back to the community through mentoring students and young professionals, by writing technical articles and organizing events and sharing knowledge through technical talks at events.
